README

**Files in /src/data**

There are two folders in /src/data. One contains our own built reference data along with measurements. The other folder contains assignment's reference data with our measurements.
The reference data should be present in internal storage location /Android/com.group20.assignment2.mobilesensing/files in order to be used by the application.

**Files in /src/MobileSensing**

The .java files for each Activity is present in /src/MobileSensing/app/src/main/java/com/group20/assignment2/mobilesensing/

Following is the description of all the activities
ListSensorsActivity.java - This activity will list all the sensors on the mobile phone along with OS and manufacturer information.
LocalizationActivity.java - Gives an interface to compute location of a measurement. Also allows creating, updating, deleting measurement data. We can also create reference data thru this activity.
MainActivity.java - List all the links to respective activities
ViewReferencePointsActivity.java - This activity will list all the reference locations and show their WiFi fingerprints
ScanWifiActivity.java - Scans wifi APs around and lists them.

Classes
LocationPoint.java - This class signifies a location point. An object of this class can be a measurement location or a reference location. It has a method to calculate euclidean distance from another location point.
WifiAP.java - Stores details of a wifi access point (BSSID, SSID, level, etc.)
